In Benin City, creativity and ambition are as vibrant as the city itself, and we are building a platform that empowers individuals to turn their aspirations into reality.

## Osas' Story

Osas, a resident of Benin City, Nigeria, had long dreamed of opening her own caf√©. However, she faced a harsh reality: she didn't have enough money to make her dream come true. Determined, Osas approached banks for a loan, but her applications were repeatedly rejected due to insufficient collateral and credit history.

Disappointed, she turned to her friends for support. They suggested crowdfunding, but traditional platforms like GoFundMe presented their own challenges. As a Nigerian, Osas had limited access to financial services, faced bureaucratic hurdles, long approval times, hidden fees, and lacked transparency.

### Challenges of Traditional Crowdfunding

-   **Limited Flexibility**: Platforms like GoFundMe often have rigid requirements, limiting creativity and innovation.
-   **Gatekeeping**: Many traditional platforms require a lengthy approval process, frustrating creators.
-   **High Processing Fees**: Traditional platforms charge high fees, reducing the funds creators receive.

These challenges highlighted the need for a more flexible, accessible, and affordable solution.

## The Solution: Crawdify

Osas needed a transparent, accessible, and efficient platform to launch her campaign and connect with her friends globally. After much research, she found **Crawdify**, a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Base blockchain.
